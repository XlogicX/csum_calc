csum_calc
=========

Calculates an "anonymized" grocery store VIP savings card based on first 6 digits (and makes sure it ends in "2600" as last 4)

For example, if your grocery store UPC-A 12 digit barcode was 462409605847, you would feed this script the command:
csum_calc 462409

The output would look something like this:
462409702600

This is a supporting script for another project of mine: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:311438
